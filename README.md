My established taste in configuration, managed with the help of [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

### Quick Start
```
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/mostpinkest/dotfiles/raw/main/install.sh)"
```
or, for `wget`:
```
/bin/sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://github.com/mostpinkest/dotfiles/raw/main/install.sh)"
```
